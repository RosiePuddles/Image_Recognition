1) Remove pixels that aren't the right colour for each of the corners
-> Check possible points left
2) Remove rows in for the top corners where there isn't a potential top left AND top right corner
3) Do the same for the bottom row
4) Remove columns in the top and bottom left possible positions where there isn't a potential top left AND bottom left
5) Do the same for the right hand column
6) Repeat 2-5 since removed values may impact earlier changes
-> Check possible points left
7) Save all possible positions for each pixel to an array
8) Work out the edge with the least possible positions (multiply number of corner possibilities together)
9) Using this edge, work through each possible point pairing until one pair matches
10) Take this pair and look down the columns they're in until two other corners are found
11) Check that the new edges match the sub-image
12) If they do return, if not keep looking
